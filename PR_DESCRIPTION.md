## 🌓 Dark Mode Implementation

### Problem Solved
Initially, the dark mode toggle wasn't working because the Navbar and Layout had separate, unconnected theme states.

### Solution
Implemented React Context for global theme management:

**New Files**:
- `contexts/ThemeContext.js` - Global theme state with localStorage persistence
- `app/ClientLayout.js` - Client wrapper that applies theme classes

**Updated Files**:
- `app/layout.js` - Now wraps app with ThemeProvider
- `components/Navbar.js` - Uses `useTheme()` hook

**Result**: 
- ✅ Toggle works instantly across entire app
- ✅ Theme persists in localStorage
- ✅ Ant Design components update automatically
- ✅ No hydration warnings

## 🎓 Technical Notes

### Why React Context for Theme?
- Global state management without prop drilling
- Single source of truth for theme state
- Automatic re-renders when theme changes
- localStorage integration for persistence
- Prevents hydration mismatches with mounted check

### Why Separate ClientLayout?
- Maintains Next.js App Router server/client boundary
- Allows layout.js to be a server component
- Client-side theme logic isolated
- Better performance and SEO

### Animation Strategy
- Use `whileInView` for scroll-triggered animations
- CSS transforms for 60 FPS performance
- Stagger children for sequential reveals
- Spring animations for natural motion
- Lazy loading to reduce initial bundle
